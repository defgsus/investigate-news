## Investigate NEWS

Personal playground for data collection and examination.

I don't like reading news but i like [building statistics](https://defgsus.github.io/blog/2022/04/02/frontpage-archive.html).

Basically it's a collection of code and data from other projects. 
Code and documentation is always english but most - if not all - data sources are
german. 

- [defgsus/teletext-archive-2023](https://github.com/defgsus/teletext-archive-2023): daily snapshots of teletext pages
- [defgsus/frontpage-archive-2023](https://github.com/defgsus/frontpage-archive-2023): daily snapshots of news headlines
- [defgsus/tv-archive](https://github.com/defgsus/tv-archive): daily snapshot of TV programme

The following repos also have related content

- [defgsus/kek-online-archive](https://github.com/defgsus/kek-online-archive): archive of german media ownership
- [defgsus/office-schedule-data](https://github.com/defgsus/office-schedule-data): snapshots of public office appointment schedules
